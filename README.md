# JavaScript Loose Comparison with Null and Undefined

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to loose comparison (==) with null and undefined values.  The `bug.js` file contains code that uses loose comparison, leading to potential unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that uses strict comparison (===) to avoid these issues.  This improves the clarity and predictability of the code.

## Loose Comparison Issues

JavaScript's loose comparison operator (==) performs type coercion before comparison, which can lead to unexpected results when comparing null or undefined values. For example, null == undefined evaluates to true, even though null and undefined are distinct values.

## Strict Comparison Solution

The strict equality operator (===) avoids type coercion. This ensures that comparison is performed only if the types are also the same, eliminating unexpected results.
